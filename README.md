# gce-sleep

Tool for shutting down/starting up Google Cloud Engine instances based on tags for savings costs when not in use.

**Current version: v0.0.10**

Concept lovingly stolen and adapted from [gce-bedtime](https://github.com/lbn/gce-bedtime).

## Getting Started

### Installing

Download a version from the [releases](https://github.com/domudall/gce-sleep/releases) page on Github, and place it into your local bin folder.

### Tagging

`gce-sleep` iterates through all the instances for a particular project (defined in the config below) for the tag: `gce-sleep-group` to determine if an instance needs to be woken or not. Tag cloud instances accordingly.

### Running

#### Config

Default config location: `/etc/gce-sleep.conf`

```hcl
project "gce-sleep-testing" {
	zones = [
		"europe-west1-c"
	]
}

ruleset "weekly-sleep" {
	startTime = "06:00"
	stopTime = "19:00"
	timezone = "Europe/London"
	days = [
		1,
		2,
		3,
		4,
		5
	]
}
```
